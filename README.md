This is a project made with NextJS, using the page router. The backend uses Firebase for auth and storage. To summarize, this is a toy SaaS project involving an embeddable comments section to a website of your choice. I added three subscription tiers with Stripe.

There are some issues with the app still, as I made this a long time ago when I had much less knowledge of JS and the web overall.

If I had to remake this app now, I would make use of simple vanilla JS and any lightweight backend. If a framework was needed, I would opt for VueJS on the frontend. NextJS is probably overkill for this anyway. 🙂
