# 💬 RemarkRadar — Embed Comments, Made Simple

## ✨ What is RemarkRadar?

**RemarkRadar** lets you embed a comments section on your website with ease — complete with moderation through an admin panel.  
Yes, it really *is* that simple.

## 🛠️ Notes on Development

This project was built with:

- ⚛️ **Next.js** (Page Router)
- ⚡ **Chakra UI** for the UI components
- 🔐 **Firebase** for authentication and data storage
- 💳 **Stripe** for subscriptions (3 tiers)

In short, this is a **toy SaaS project** that provides an embeddable comments system for any website.

⚠️ **Important note:**  
This app was created a long time ago, when I had far less experience with JavaScript and web development. As a result, there are known issues and design decisions I would not make today.

### 🔄 If I Were to Rebuild This Today

- Use **vanilla JavaScript** for the embed script
- Pick a **lightweight backend**
- Prefer **Vue.js** for the frontend if a framework is needed
- Avoid **Next.js**, which is likely overkill for this use case 🙂

> [!WARNING]  
> Some paid GCP services used by Firebase have been cancelled.  
> As a result, the demo **may not be fully functional** and **may contain bugs**.
